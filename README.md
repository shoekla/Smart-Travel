# Smart-Travel
Android Application that allows users to optimize their road trip (both short and long) by letting them pause their trip and get them to their choice of gas station, and food restaurant.  This is done through multiple options to make the process as intuitive and easy as possible. Since Google Maps does not allow the embedding of turn by turn navigation, this is done using multi-action android notifications so user can access "Smart Travel" without leaving Google Maps.

#Update for Smart Travel
I am currently updating the android application to work for android auto so users are not distracted by driving while on the app. Also I am making a few front end changes including background images, image buttons instead of regular buttons and landscape variations for different xml layouts.

#Smart Travel 2.0
Smart Travel now works for android mobile and android auto (an intuitive layout for both). Smart Travel finds gas stations, restaurants, and other place marks (via voice commands) using android notifications allowing the app to be utilized with android wear (tested).
